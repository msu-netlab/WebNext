\section{Peer Feedback Summary}
According to the feedback from our peers, we classify feedback into several primary points: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The motivation of our project was very well explained. 
    Our presentation allowed people to completely follow the content we discussed.
    \item We provided detailed and an easy-to-understand background on the problem.
    One of the reasons for this, as mentioned in the feedback, is that we had a well-defined story to tell and we were not too fast when discussing technical details.
    \item Our peers understood the real world applications of our project -- why the project is going to be useful and for whom it will be useful.
    \item People were also satisfied with the figures we used in our slides. In fact, the choice of our figures helped many to understand the problem statement more clearly.
    \item Finally, we did not receive any negative comment about neither the technical content and nor for our presentation.
    However, we did receive some interesting questions that we might want to look into as an extension to this work.
\end{itemize}
